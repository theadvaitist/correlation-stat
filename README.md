# CorrelationFinder

## Overview

**CorrelationFinder** is a Python-based script that calculates the correlation coefficient between two variables using Excel data. Whether you're analyzing financial data, scientific measurements, or any other dataset, this application provides a quick and efficient way to determine the strength and direction of the relationship between variables.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: The application offers an intuitive interface where users can input their data directly from an Excel file.

- **Calculation of Correlation Coefficient**: Once the data is provided, the calculator computes the correlation coefficient (Pearson's r) and displays the result.

- **Executable File**: The script has been converted into an executable file named "CorrelationFinder.exe."

## Getting Started

1. **Installation**:
   - Download the "CorrelationFinder.exe" file from the releases section.
   - Run the executable on your Windows machine.

2. **Usage**:
   - Double-click the "CorrelationFinder.exe" file.
   - Input your data (X and Y values) when prompted.
   - The correlation coefficient will be displayed.

3. **Example**:
   - Suppose you have an Excel file with the following data:
     ```
     X: [10, 15, 20, 25, 30]
     Y: [25, 30, 35, 40, 45]
     ```
   - Running "CorrelationFinder.exe" will yield a positive correlation coefficient (close to 1).
